# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Titanic passenger data to predict survival rates using various machine learning models. The dataset is preprocessed, and multiple models are trained to evaluate their performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, commonly available for predictive modeling tasks. It includes features like passenger class, age, gender, fare, and more.

## Project Structure
- `data_preprocessing.ipynb` - Cleans and preprocesses the Titanic dataset.
- `models.ipynb` - Trains and evaluates different machine learning models.

## Installation
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn torch
```

## Usage
1. Open and run `data_preprocessing.ipynb` to clean the dataset.
2. Open and run `models.ipynb` to train and evaluate models.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Neural Networks (PyTorch)
- Cross-validation techniques

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Results
The models' performance is evaluated based on the above metrics. Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the `models.ipynb` notebook.
